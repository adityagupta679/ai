#### Install virtualenvwrapper-win package
#### At its core, the main purpose of Python virtual environments is to create an isolated environment for Python projects. 
#### This means that each project can have its own dependencies, regardless of what dependencies every other project has.
####
#### We are using virtualenvwrapper-win library for managing virtual environments
#### Link to virtualenvwrapper-win library documentation  https://pypi.org/project/virtualenvwrapper-win/

# Make a virtual environment branchcashprediction 


mkvirtualenv -a E:\Projects\IITJ_AI iitj_ai #mkvirtualenv branchcashprediction # this will make a virtual env with default tools like pip etc, and also activate the environment for you.

## Now setup ypur project directory in E:\Projects  
## Project Directory shuld have a requirements file 

# Every project should have a requirements file , (a text file with all the libraries required for the job in separate lines)
# Use the below command to set up the environment for your project with the requied libraries. 
pip install --no-index --find-links "E:\PYTHONRSETUP\PyPackages" -r E:\Projects\BranchCashPrediction\requirements.txt
